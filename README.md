# Banana-Sales-Analysis

### PROJECT OVERVIEW

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of a subscription based Software as a Service (SaaS) company over the past years. By analyzing various aspects of the data, we seek to identify trends and pick out useful information to make data driven recommendations about upselling of non-paying customers, forecast the future sales of the company and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance and how improvement in its performance can drive the sales of the company further.

### Data Sources

Data : the primary data used for this analysis is the "Banana_Sales_Data.csv" containing detailed information about the sales of the company over the years, how the data was cleaned,prepared and analysed for insights to answer the main questions surrounding upselling of non-paying customers and also further analysed to gain more useful insights that can help the company's performance.

   - Reducing the columns to only those required for analysis
   - Adding new calculated field columns derived from the data present

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involved exploring the Banana sales data to answer questions that help in understanding the data, find trends and correlation and also generate hypothesis for further analysis. The following was observed:
1. Banana has sold over 35,101 subscriptions for $693,025, with an average customer bringing in $312 each month.
2. It is observed that there are some non-paying users since the number of users does not tally with the number of licences bought, an average of $20 is the sales per subscribers(this was derived by using the number of licenses bought) which is broken down by the subscriber type into $0 for basic, $10 for Premium, $25 for business and $27 for enterprise

### Data Analytics

1. With the existence of non-paying customers,the senior management is looking to identify upsell opportunities. Upsell means getting non-paying accounts to convert to paying accounts. In this dataset, the Subscription Type has four tiers. From worst to best, they are Basic, Premium, Business, and Enterprise. Based on futher analysis of the data, it's incredible that throughout the entire sales history, Bananas could have made over $272,000 had all their customers been paying. This is a big opportunity for them to make more money from existing customers even though  we can't go back in the past to collect this money.

2. This begs for the question about which accounts should be targeted for upsell opportunities. The Upsell of the last month(Current Upsell) was determined for each group and grouped based on priority of upsell opportunities into into: High - >= 400,Medium - >=100, Low - <100
